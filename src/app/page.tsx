              Since 2006, AV's Cabinets has served as guardians of an ancient craft, creating bespoke cabinetry and architectural millwork that honors both tradition and innovation. Our workshop in California's heartland combines time-tested joinery techniques with contemporary design sensibilities, producing pieces that will grace homes for generations.

              Every project begins with understandingâ€”of your lifestyle, your home's architecture, and the materials that will become part of your daily experience. We believe in quiet luxury: craftsmanship so refined it speaks in whispers, not shouts.
